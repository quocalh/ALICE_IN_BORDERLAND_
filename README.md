for the sake of time, i was able to deploy the most dogshit code i ever written, no enums, no separated file for graphic, no optimization, only supports multiple threads, with some really questionable classes, i knew i had not done it right but continue to push it further anyways, i mean 2 months for this is crazy i cant lie. Anyways, fuck my skillset.
